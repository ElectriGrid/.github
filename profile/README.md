## Hi! This is the ElectrGrid Capstone Project (MEDS 2026) Landing Page 👋

**Project summary**

Distributed energy resources (DER) are small-scale energy generation and storage technologies, such as rooftop solar or electric vehicles, that play a significant role in the rapid decarbonization of the energy system. The integration of DERs and the electrification of residential buildings and transportation require grid infrastructure capacity, which may be inequitably distributed across communities. There is currently no streamlined method for determining these inequities that considers both grid infrastructure and socioeconomic data. Through this project, the capstone team will create a reproducible workflow that automates the linkage between the two data sources in order to assess gaps between electrification needs and grid infrastructure hosting or load capacity. These analytical tools and data products will help utility grid planners, state energy regulators, and community advocacy groups ensure a more equitable decarbonization process.
